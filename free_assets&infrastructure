# Hey Pokémon Red Experimenters, need infrastructure or assets?


###
Yo, fellow Pokémon Red fans and experimenters,

Guess what? I'm packing some serious tech muscle and I'm itching to share it with all of you. I've got a whole stash of cool stuff – datacenters, cloud servers, VPSs, virtual machines, unlimited MariaDB databases, hosting, and more domains than you can shake a Poké Ball at!

## What's in My Tech Arsenal

- **The Hardware:** includes datacenter resources, cloud servers that could take on a legendary Pokémon, VPSs that are as nimble as an Eevee, and virtual machines that can adapt to any task.

- **Unleash the Databases:** I've got a MariaDB database party going on, and you're all invited. Unlimited databases to handle your data needs!

- **Home for Your Projects:** Need a home for your projects? I've got hosting services that'll make sure your Pokémon experiments never go offline.

- **Domain Extravaganza:** Domains? I've got a bunch. Let's pick the perfect one for your Pokémon adventure. (over 400, and over 40,000 subdomains)

## Collaboration and Team-Up

I'm all about that collaboration life. If you want a tech-savvy buddy who can lend a hand, resources, or just some good ol' coding wisdom to your Pokémon Red experiments, I'm your guy.

Hit me up and let's chat about how we can make the Pokémon Red experiments even more epic. No need to be formal, just give me a shout, and we'll dive into the techy, Pokémon-filled world together.

Catch you on the tech side!

Cheers,
Spiritus Veritas ```
